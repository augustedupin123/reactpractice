<!-- AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript and XML
AJAX just uses a combination of : A browser built in XML HTTP request object(to request data from  web server)
Javascript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data) -->
<!-- AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with web server behind the scenes. This means that it's possible
to update parts of a web page without reloading the web page. -->

// The fetch API provides a fetch() method defined on the window object, which can be used to perform requests.
// This method returns a promise that can be used to retrieve the response of the request.
